/*
Build a recipe book application
Recipe book must have at least three recipes

Each Recipe needs to have a
name – eg Pizza
cooking time in minutes – eg 10
key ingredient eg “cheese”
Star rating – eg *****

Ask 'user' for the key ingredient (NOTE: You'll do this through code calling the function, not getting input from the command line!)
display all recipes containing that ingredient

Bonus Points:
Move ingredients to a separate struct, and allow a search on any of the listed ingredients, eg cheese, tomato, bread dough
